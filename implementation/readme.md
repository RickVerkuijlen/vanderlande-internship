**What repositories are included?**

- fe-push-notification-poc
- be-push-notification-poc

## Proof of concept 3

This proof of concept is something different. To spend my time well, we have decided to create a chat proof of concept. This has nothing to do with the previous proof of concepts. For the presistance of the application, a local Kafka installation was used.

- fe-chat-poc
